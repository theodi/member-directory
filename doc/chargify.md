Chargify integration
===========================

MailChimp integration
---------------------

This needs to be set up in Chargify. You choose a `list` that subscribers will
be synced to.  You canâ€™t remove or add other members to this list as it will be
kept in sync with the subscriptions in Chargify.

So mail outs may want to use a combination of lists or subsets based on product.

Product setup
-------------

For each pricing plan available for supporters there needs to be a product
setup in Chargify that maps to it by setting the `API Handle`.

Currently the system expects there to be products for

  1. `individual_supporter`
  2. `supporter_annual`
  3. `corporate_supporter_annual`

You can then set up the `Recurring Period and Price` for each of these
products. `Initial/Setup Fee` can be left blank as Chargify starts billing
immediately for the recurring payment.

Everytime you create a product you need to make sure there is a `Public Signup
Page` set up for the product with the `Return url` and `Return parameters` set
to these values:

### Return url

    https://directory.theodi.org/members/chargify_return

### Return parameters

    reference={customer_reference}&customer_id={customer_id}&subscription_id={subscription_id}&payment_id={signup_payment_id}

Webhook setup
-------------

A webhook for `signup success` needs to be set up to verify that payments are
recorded correctly using this url:

    https://directory.theodi.org/members/chargify_verify

Discounts
---------

Coupon codes can be set up in Chargify too, the coupon code you choose needs to
be appened to the new member url so instead of the usual:

    https://directory.theodi.org/members/new?level=individual

or

    https://directory.theodi.org/members/new?level=supporter

You will need to append `&coupon={COUPONCODE}` on the end. eg:

    https://directory.theodi.org/members/new?level=individual&coupon=COUPONCODE

or
    https://directory.theodi.org/members/new?level=supporter&coupon=COUPONCODE
