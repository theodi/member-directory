Feature: Bulk upload of student members

  Background:
    Given I am logged in as an administrator
    And I visit the student bulk upload page

  Scenario: Download a template CSV file
    When I click "Download template CSV"
    Then I should receive a CSV file called "sample.csv"
    And that CSV file should contain columns for all student signup fields
    And that CSV should have an example line.
    
  Scenario: Upload a CSV file full of students
    When I select the file "upload/students.csv" for upload
    And that file contains a set of student details
    Then their details should be queued for further processing
    When I click "Upload"
    Then I should see the results of my upload
    And I should see "Bob Fish <bob@example.edu>"
    And a student membership should be created for "bob@example.edu"
    And that member should be set up in Chargify
    And a welcome email should be sent to "bob@example.edu"
    And they should see "To activate your account" in the email body
    When they follow "here" in the email
    Then they should see "Set your password"
